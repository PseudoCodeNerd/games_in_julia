## Task Statement

Make a rock-paper-scissors game in Julia **without if/else statements**.
For this task, you will be creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game in Julia. The game should be single-player and be played against an AI that you make.

This should be pretty straightforward so the caveat for this task is that you **must not use if/else statements** and are instead restricted to the use of the **Ternary Operator** which you can learn about more [here.](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/control-flow/#man-conditional-evaluation-1)

- Create a Julia program that is a single-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
- Upload the code to GitHub as a Gist, Notebook, or Repository and link it here.
- Provide screenshots on GitHub of how the game is played.

Note that you can not use if/else statements.
